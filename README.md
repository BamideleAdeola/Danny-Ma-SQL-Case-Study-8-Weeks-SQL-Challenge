Danny Ma's SQL Challenge

📚 Case Study #1: Danny's Diner
This repository contains my solutions for Case Study #1: Danny's Diner from the 8 Weeks SQL Challenge by Danny Ma.

🏁 Objective
Danny, the owner of Danny's Diner, wants to better understand his customer base and purchasing habits. He has shared 3 key datasets and 10 business questions to help guide his analysis. As a data analyst, I will answer these questions using SQL.

🧑‍💻 Case Study Questions
1. Danny provided the following questions to analyze the data:
2. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
3. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
4. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
5. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
6. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
7. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
8. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
9. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
10. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier, how many points would each customer have? In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date), they earn 2x points on all items. How many points do Customer A and B have at the end of January?
